# Task 03 - Text Generation with Markov Chains

This project implements a simple Markov Chain algorithm for generating random text based on a given input. It learns the word transitions from the input text and then uses this knowledge to generate new, coherent-looking text.

## Features
- Tokenizes and cleans text
- Builds a Markov chain model
- Generates text of desired length

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run each cell sequentially.
3. Change the start_word in the last cell to explore different outputs.

## Sample Output

> the king had a daughter who loved to explore the forests and rivers one day she discovered
